## Acknowledgements
SBH couldn't have been created without the help of `Sebastien Beurnier` and `Leon Ma`, as well as other members of the `Stuyvesant High School Science Bowl Team`. They've been invaluable testers of the bot, as well as moral support for all of the times the bot crashed. 

Special acknowledgement goes to `Kiran Duggirala` for assisting me with the concurrent games feature, as well as helping refactor some of the files.
